Welcome to my chatbot project. 

This project aims to showcase:
-Foundational coding ability, through the overall implementation of this software
-The adaptation of both existing and emerging python libraries
-Natural Language Process knowledge, through pre-processing of user inputs using Spacy
-Understanding of LLMs and Cogntive Models, through the use of OpenAI's models
-Low-level user-interface and application development through HTML templates and Flask
-Professional code-development techniques, such as data collection, Git management, and testing

Future work to be done:
-Tokenization counting
-Chat-style user-interface, for multiple input chats that the chatbot will remember
-Speech-to-text and text-to-speech, for optional verbal conversing (as oppose to text-only)
-Fine-tuning for a specific domain of knowledge, to showcase further model understanding and data management
-Deployment through AWS, so this project can be run on the cloud rather than locally
